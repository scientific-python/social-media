# Social Media Guidelines

*Some  of these guidelines were adapted from:*
- https://marketing.dask.org/en/latest/
- https://github.com/matplotlib/governance/blob/main/communicationsguidelines.md 

## Content Guidelines:

| Platform | Content  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Twitter  | Releases, new features, conferences and grants deadlines, blog posts, specs, share YouTube videos |
| Facebook  | Short videos (Maybe same as TikTok, cut parts from YouTube videos), blogposts, pictures of events or meetings. |
| Instagram  | Quotes (To create identity), pictures of events, conferences. |
| YouTube  | Tutorials, meet-ups, interviews. |
| TikTok  | (cut parts from YouTube videos), short tutorials |

## Acceptable topics:

- Specs ?? (Announcements)
- Python, NumFOCUS libraries
- New releases or important features of relevant projects
- Documentation, talks, blog posts by relevant projects
- Grants: PSF, Numfocus, GSOC (deadlines, winners?)
- Conferences or other events from the Scientific Python community
- (maybe make a list of all the relevant accounts to follow for retweets)

## Content verification

- Instagram/blog: ensure Scientific Python has right to repost/share content
- Make sure content is clearly cited
    - example: a tutorial using someone elseâ€™s example clearly cites the original source
- Limited self/corporate promotion is acceptable, but should be no more than about a quarter of the content of the blog/discourse post. (Or better - NO profit promotional or sales material)
- If you think content is borderline, ask before publishing it
- Site guidelines:

## Accessibility

- Add alt text to images and videos when the platform allows
    - https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/
    - https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81
- Warn on bright, strobing, images & turn off autoplay if possible
- For images made by the social media team:
    - make graphic perceivable to people who cannot perceive color well, due to color-blindness or low vision
    - do not make bright, strobing images

### Behavior Guidelines

- Keep responses polite, assume user statements are in good faith unless they violate the Code of Conduct
- Never block anyone

### Recurrent Social Media Campaigns:

- Release Announcements
    - Highlight new features & major deprecations
    - Link to download/install instructions
    - Ask folks to try it out.
- Signal boost third party packages
- GSOC work during GSOC recruiting and work times

## Social Media Following Guide:

- Only follow organizations/projects - mostly numfocus projects
    - especially 3rd party packages
    - sponsors are also acceptable
- Do not follow individual accounts for any reason (even maintainers/project leads/Guido!)

## Twitter Persona

- It is a Scientific Python community, so talks about itself as a we, us, our, and it. Avoids talking about itself in the 3rd person.
- Very earnest, eager to please, and aims to be patient & painfully oblivious to snark and sarcasm.
- Gets over-excited, lots of emojis and encourages folks to share their work.
- Highlights Scientific Python projects (events, releases)
