## Names

When creating a new account, here are the preferred names (the first being the most desirable):

- scientific.python
- scientific_python
- scientific.py
- scientific_py

We aim for consistency, but avoid dashes (like in our domain name) because most social media platforms won't allow it. On platforms that don't allow any of the above, use:

- ScientificPython
- ScientificPy
