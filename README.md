# social-media

This repo contains notes used by the community managers for social media stuff.

## Names

When creating a new account, here are the preferred handle names (the first being the most desirable):

- scientific.python
- scientific_python
- scientific.py
- scientific_py

We aim for consistency, but avoid dashes (like in our domain name) because most social media platforms won't allow it. On platforms that don't allow any of the above, use:

- ScientificPython
- ScientificPy

The **full name** should be:

- Scientific Python

## Bio / About

The bio / message / or whatever they call it should be:

- Community developed, community owned

If the allow space for a longer bio as well, use:

The Scientific Python ecosystem is a loose federation of community developed
and owned Python projects widely used in scientific research, technical
computing, and data science.

This <website> is part of the Scientific Python project, which aims to better
coordinate the ecosystem and prepare Scientific Python for the next decade.

## Email address

community-managers@discuss.scientific-python.org

## Date of birth

We use August 19, 2001---the first release of scipy as the project's date of birth for social media accounts.
