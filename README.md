## Names

Ideally, our handle on social media would be scientific-python, but
several services have different naming limitations.

When creating a new account, here are the preferred names (the first being the most desirable):

scientific-python
scientific.python
scientific_python
ScientificPython
scientific-py
scientific.py
scientific_py
ScientificPy
