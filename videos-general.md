# Interviews :busts_in_silhouette:

Interviews with project developers / maintainers from core projects in the
ecosystem focusing on how they got involved, what their projects are like, and
how new people can contribute.

## Format

- Recorded in zoom (Live interviews)
- 10-20 minutes long
- Questions will be displayed as labels in the video
- Scientific Python icon will be displayed at the top right
- Outro with "Scientific Python" label
- Social media handles displayed at the end

## Sample questions

1. Introduction
2. What drove you to contribute to open source and what was your first open source contribution?
3. How did you become a maintainer and what was the greatest challenge?
4. Why did you decide to “stay” in the Scientific Python community?
5. What are you doing to make the Scientific Python community better?
6. Why should someone consider joining the Scientific Python community?
7. Can you give some advice to someone that wants to contribute to the Scientific Python ecosystem?

# Explanations :book:

We will create videos to orient new people to the ecosystem and show them how they can learn more.
These videos will provide the missing insider understanding of how the various projects fit together,
what their community culture is like, what they need help with, and how to contribute.

## Format

- Recorded with white background. (Just face and shoulders visible in the frame)
- 3-4 minutes long
- Subtitles and steps will be displayed as labels in the video
- Scipy icon will be displayed at the top right
- Outro with "Welcome to the Scientific Python Community" label


## Community

2. 5 ways to contribute to Scientific Python without coding
	- Issue testing and triaging
	- Reviewing PRs
	- Improving documentation
	- Translations
	- Participating in the community
3. Getting started with Scientific Python
	- How to choose a project to work on?
	- What tools to learn?
	- How to make your first contribution?
4. Choosing a project to contribute
	- Understanding the project
	- Contributing to the ecosystem
	- Learn more about a project
5. How to make your first contribution to open source?
	- How to clone and fork a repo?
	- How to set a development environment?
	- How to make a PR?
	- Project: NetworkX

## Ecosystem

1. Ecosystem Introduction
2. Installing packages
3. Installing packages using conda
4. Installing packages using pip
5. Running Python Code

## Other ideas for videos

1. How to become a mantainer?
2. How to write good docs?
3. The Open source community

# Demos :computer:

We will create videos giving an over-the-shoulder glance at how a developer would typically solve a problem and contribute that solution back to the scientific Python ecosystem.

## How-tos

As part of demos we can have short (1-2 min) how-to videos that we can link in other videos for very short explanations on common problems that people can find or FAQs. (This could also be used for TikTok since we mentioned we want to create one at some point.)

1. How to create a GitHub account
2. How to set a terminal or command line
3. How to choose your editor or IDE?
4. How to install Git in your computer?
5. How to install Conda?

# Other resources :boom:

- **TikTok**
	- Short how-tos
	- Small fragments of the interviews
- **Live videos** (The advantage of live videos is that they are an easy way to create material faster that remains in YouTube.)
	- Invite speakers for a short demo on a particular project
	- Short workshops on particular projects (numpy, scipy, scikit-learn)
- **Social gatherings**
	- Host more informal events in platforms like [gather town](https://www.gather.town) where people can get involved with the community and ask questions.
