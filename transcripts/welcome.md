# Welcome to Scientific Python

Hi, and welcome to Scientific Python!

This is a project, run by volunteers, to better coordinate and support scientific Python libraries and the people who build them. We want to grow the community of contributors, and provide an even better experience for users and developers of the scientific Python tools we've come to know and love.

One of the first things we are doing is making a series of community onboarding videos, like the one you are watching right now! We will also publish interviews, developer discussions, and showcase scientific Python libraries. All this will be posted on social media outlets such as YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

If you want to talk to us, you can join our discussion forum. There, we discuss  questions on how to use and contribute to scientific Python tools, or anything related to Scientific Python.
